# MGS3 PC Randomizer 1.0 (Tested on EU version)
Metal Gear Solid 3 Item/Weapon/Medic/Camo/Food randomizer for PC Master Collection version made with CheatEngine using LUA/Assembly.

DISCLAIMER : Be aware that CheatEngine is a memory reading/modifying software which can be seen as a threat, antiviruses may trigger, I would recommend using a specific location out of virus scan for this.

# How to use
- Download the EXE file, launch the game until main menu, launch the Trainer, wait for the trainer to recognize mgs process and get data, choose custom settings and click Randomize to test it.
- Can be activated/deactivated anytime, but I would suggest to let it activated during play.
(MUST BE MAIN MENU, FIRST LAUNCH & NO GAME STARTED YET)
- After using this trainer, I suggest to verify and close any running cheat engine process, in case any anticheat program is launched after.(never had any problem on my side)

# Randomizing what and how ?
Since there wasn't any MGS3 randomizer, again I made my own, it's not perfect but if it can make people play a bit more at this gem of a game then it's a job done.
- This Randomizer will randomize Weapon/Item/Medic/Camo/Food for every pickup according to the player's belongings.
- Random Vomit and random Fake Death are also randomized on pickup
- Special Weapon/Item/Camo can be activated/deactivated for pickup via checkbox
- Naked Start checkbox allow player to limit start stuff, only few weapn/item/camo
- For the CheatEngine choice, which will modify game data during gameplay, 
  it is mostly because I wanted to make a quick and simple launcher to make and use without the need of too much external components.

# Issues
- Some Freeze/Crash can appear as it is an early version
- Fast multiple pickup may not display correctly the pickup name
- During WIG standoff, if can't pickup SAA, must empty all bullets from equipped SAA
- Start Naked activated, some empty Item/Weapon can appear in inventory
- Random Fake Death activated, some death are finalon certain positions (against wall/water/mud)
- Random food can be half rotten/rotten on pickup, depends on behaviour & locations
- Throwing food and picking it up again gives random pickup again
- Random Silencer may not add up correctly
- Random camo can give already obtained basic camo
- End game weapon may not cause damage to early bosses
- If no bullets before sidecar, weapon won't be infinite in sidecar
(if no SVD bullet for bridge, RPG7 or others works)

Feel free to report any encountered issues.
